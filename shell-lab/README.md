## This is just a basic implementation of a shell with minimal functionality
# To run just call python shellSergio.py

## Commands
# Some of the basic commands implemented in the shell are echo, ls, pwd, and cd
# To execute other programs from my shell, type 'exec [filename] [Additional files]'
# For help on the commands in the shell, type 'help'
# Piping does NOT work, but there is some code for it
